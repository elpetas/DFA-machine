# DFA Machine
This is a Java project that allows users to create and manipulate Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA).

## Getting Started
To run the program, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. Once you have Java installed, you can follow these steps:

Download or clone the project from the repository
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
Compile the program by running the command: javac DFAmain.java
Run the program by running the command: java DFAmain

##Usage
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter information about the DFA you want to create. You will be asked for the alphabet, the set of states, the set of final states, the start state, and the transition function.

After creating the DFA, you will be presented with a menu of options:

Print DFA: prints a table representation of the DFA
Test if string is accepted: tests whether a string is accepted by the DFA
Swap symbols and copy DFA: creates a copy of the DFA with two symbols swapped
Quit: exits the program
To choose an option, enter the corresponding number at the prompt.
